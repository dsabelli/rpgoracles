# RPG Oracles

RPG Oracles is an online platform for game masters, dungeon masters, and storytellers who are looking for inspiration and guidance in their tabletop role-playing game (RPG) campaigns.

With RPG Oracles, users can choose from a range of genres, including fantasy, horror, science fiction, and more, to create random story prompts, NPCs, settings, and encounters.

Whether you're a seasoned RPG veteran or just starting out, RPG Oracles is a valuable resource that can help bring your RPG campaigns to life.

## Why Did I Make This

RPG Oracles is my own personal tool to help manage my solo role-playing games. Instead of having multiple documents open, or binders of papers, I decided to use RPG Oracles as a repository for all such documents. I also now have the ability to build and share this repository to others.

## What Did I Learn

I was learning Vue.js to use for upcoming work projects and wanted to practice what I'd learned through this project.
I also took the opportunity to learn about server-side rendering (SSR) using the Nuxt.js framework, and was also able to easily set up a REST API for this project with Nitro.

I've previously worked with NoSQL databases, so I wanted to gain experience designing and using a SQL database. I went with Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, which utilizes PostgreSQL. I connected to the database through Prisma, a NodeJS and TypeScript ORM, which handled all queries with type-safety.

Finally, I deployed the entire application using Vercel!

## How To Use

RPG Oracles contains many different oracles and random tables. Simply find what you're looking for by using the navigation menu, which organizes documents based on genres and sub-genres. Once you've found the table you're looking for, simply click the roll button to obtain a result, or roll the dice yourself and look up the result on the table!
